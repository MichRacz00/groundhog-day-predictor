# Interactive Groundhog Day Predictor

A simple, single-page website that provides a fun, interactive Groundhog Day prediction. Users can "wake up" a groundhog to find out if there will be six more weeks of winter or an early spring.

## Features

*   **Interactive Animation:** Click a button to make the groundhog emerge from its burrow.
*   **Randomized Outcome:** The prediction (early spring or more winter) is randomly generated with a 50/50 chance.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The background color and animations change depending on the outcome.
    *   **Early Spring:** The scene turns green.
    *   **More Winter:** The scene turns a colder blue, and the groundhog sees its shadow.
*   **Minimalist Design:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No libraries or frameworks required.

2.  Open the file directly in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
